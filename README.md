#### Version 2.0

###### Fitbit OAuth
Users will be able to authorize the app via OAuth instead of Fitbit's implicit grant authorization flow, which requires a user to be currently logged in to Fitbit to gain access.

###### Treatment Modules
In the next iteration, The 'Treatment' tab will allow users to compare their insomnia 30 days before and 30 days after a treatment module is started.  For example, a user will be able to eliminate caffeine for 30 days, and the app will track whether insomnia improves as a result.
