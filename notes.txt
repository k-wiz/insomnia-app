Day 1, May 9th:
Today I wrote my data model at model.py, seeded the db with sample data from seed.py, and defined basic routes at server.py.  I also created a basic daily entry form that successfully sends data to the dashboard route. TOMORROW: Use form data to create new db entry. Make sure data formats are correct. Refine form or move on to dashboard?

Day 2, May 10th: 
Converted all form inputs to correct data type, allowing new entries to be added to database. (2 hours) 

Day 3, May 11th:
Spent all day creating function to calculate user's averqage hours of sleep per night, 
median hours of sleep per night, average level of insomnia, and median level of insomnia. Passed through to template, correctly formatted. Median functions took me so much longer
than expected!






MASTER PLAN:

1. Play around with chart.js. Is this sufficient, or do I want D3? Then:
    -Is it feasible to view data by month AND
    -when month is selected and viewed, averages and medians are recalculated?
2. Do research into data analysis techniques. Once the MVP of insights page is complete:
3. Add JS to form page. make it all pretty. 
4. If time, incorporate data from Fitbit API!!!
