Day 1, May 9th:
Today I wrote model.py and seed.py in their entirety, and defined basic routes at server.py.  I also created the basic entry form that successfully sends data to the dashboard route. TOMORROW: Use form data to create new db entry. Make sure data formats are correct. Refine form or move on to dashboard?
