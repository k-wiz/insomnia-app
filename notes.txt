Day 1, May 9th:
Today I wrote my data model at model.py, seeded the db with sample data from seed.py, and defined basic routes at server.py.  I also created a basic daily entry form that successfully sends data to the dashboard route. TOMORROW: Use form data to create new db entry. Make sure data formats are correct. Refine form or move on to dashboard?

Day 2, May 10th: 
Converted all form inputs to correct data type, allowing new entries to be added to database. (2 hours)
